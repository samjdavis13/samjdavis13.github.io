# SJD.co
Home for my personal [website][1]

### Features

- Statically generated website, built with [Jekyll][2]
- Fully mobile responsive, built with [Bootstrap][3]
- Has a lovely picture of yours truly in the header area
- Displays items from my portfolio in a grid.
- Has a functional contact form. This functions through a small PHP app I host at [sjd.site90.com][4]
- AND most importantly is very easy to keep up to date on my behalf. To add a new portfolio item, for example, I only need to create a very simple .markdown file with some YAML front-matter. Hooray! üëç
