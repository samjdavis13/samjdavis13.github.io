tools: [After Effects,Illustrator,Photoshop]

brief: To create a kinetic typography piece based on a 30 second voice over supplied by the university.
execution: Upon researching James Victore’s style as a graphic designer I found it to be quite a gritty, dirty style so this was implemented into the final animation. I also decided to base the entire animation around Victore’s rather iconic moustache.<br>The resulting piece was something that I am quite proud of as it caused me to develop new skills in design (such as Adobe After Effects) and learn a new medium.
