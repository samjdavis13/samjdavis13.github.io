client: University Assignment
service: Typography / Animation

tools: [After Effects,Illustrator,Photoshop]
values: [40,40,20]

brief: To create a kinetic typography piece based on a 30 second voice over supplied by the university.
execution: Upon researching James Victore’s style as a graphic designer I found it to be a rather gritty, dirty style. I used this as a basis for the aesthetic tone of the final animation. I also decided to base the entire animation around Victore’s <a href="http://blog.creativelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Victore.jpg">iconic moustache</a>.<br>The resulting piece was something that I am quite proud of as it caused me to develop new skills in design (such as Adobe After Effects) and delve into the field of animation.
