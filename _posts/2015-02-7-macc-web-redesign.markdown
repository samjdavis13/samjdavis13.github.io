brief: After undertaking a corporate image rebranding, the company that I work for, ‘Mount Annan Christian College’ approached me and asked me to redesign their website using the new identity and styleguide. Requests made by the client included&#58; <ol><li>Having a modern aesthetic</li><li>To reflect the new school logo</li><li>Be user editable</li></ol>
execution: Based on the fact that the brief required the website to be user editable I opted to create a website based off the WordPress content management system and build a theme around this platform.<br>What resulted was a highly functional, user editable website that was clean, elegant and reflective of the new corporate identity.<br><br>To view the final website please visit&#58; <a href="http://macc.nsw.edu.au">macc.nsw.edu.au</a>
