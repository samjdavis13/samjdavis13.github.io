brief: To create an interactive design that teaches the user how to do something.
execution: I decided to create an iPad application that teaches the user how to play the drums at a fundamental level.<br>The app accomplished this through a variety of screens that started off by letting the user experiment with the different sounds each drum makes, then learning how to read music, then finally showing them more complicated beats.<br>What resulted was a fully functioning iPad app that met the brief and got high marks.
