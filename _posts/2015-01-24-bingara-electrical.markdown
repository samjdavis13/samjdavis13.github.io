Brief: To create a company identity for the electrical company ‘Bingara Electrical’. The image was to be simple, clean & recognisable and include graphically, something of an electrical nature.
Execution: In my final design of the branding I included an abstracted shape as the main logo graphic. It’s purpose was to indicate that the company was a clean, refined company. The ring shape was suggestive of a circuit, in which energy flows through (see varying colours in logo). For the typeface I chose one that would also be clean and refined. Beyond the basic image I wanted the graphic to help distinguish itself from other electrical companies, therefore I stayed away from clichéd imagery. What resulted was an innovative logo that was true to the company it represented.
