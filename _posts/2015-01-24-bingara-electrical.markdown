brief: To create a company identity for the electrical company ‘Bingara Electrical’. The identity was to be minimal, clean & recognisable and include, graphically, something of an electrical nature.
execution: In my final design of the branding I included an abstracted shape as the main logo graphic. It’s purpose was to indicate that the company was a modern, refined company. The ring shape is suggestive of a circuit, in which energy flows through (see varying colours in logo).<br>I also chose a typeface that would be modern and refined. Beyond the basic image I wanted the graphic to help distinguish itself from other electrical companies, whilst still being useful in a practical sense. To accomplish this I stayed away from clichéd imagery and opted to design something more abstract. What resulted was a visually appealing logo that was true to the company it represented.
