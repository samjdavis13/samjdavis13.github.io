brief: I was tasked with creating an organisation that had ‘something’ to do with elderly people. The brief was purposefully open ended, in order to ensure a wide variety of work from students.
execution: Based on facts like <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2009/07/telstra-ups-fees-for-bill-payment/">being charged to recieve bills in the mail</a> and services such as <a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.humanservices.gov.au%2Fcustomer%2Fsubjects%2Fmedicare-services&ei=hjrgVL7kFaLWmgW-soDQAQ&usg=AFQjCNHZ5Rgc3fVFO8I2b8q6dZHg2k04Sg&bvm=bv.85970519,d.dGY">Medicare</a> going digital, I created a company that would help to get the elder generation working with new technology.<br>The premise for this was that we cannot stop the world from becoming a more and more connected place, so we might as well band together and help <em>everyone</em> embrace it.<br><br>Outcomes achieved:<br><ul><li>Company logo created</li><li>Small advertising campaign developed</li></ul>
