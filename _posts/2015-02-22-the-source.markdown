brief: In the first semester of the third year of university, our entire class was given the task of developing, from start to finish, a magazine. The only requisite given was that it needed to bear the name ‘The Source’. The class was to act as a design studio including applying for job roles through a written application and interview with heads of the subject. Each student was to write one article for the magazine.
execution: <p>I applied for and received the role of Image Director — responsibilites included settling on a final aesthetic for the magazine, implementing and enforcing a styleguide along with putting together the final document for sending to print.</p><p>I ended up putting together a 6 page article talking about the role of graphic design in the present and moving into the future, contributing to the designing the inside and outside covers of the magazine.</p><p>My role in the team was stretched slighty as I handled some of the communications with printers and production companies. Finally at the end of the project I handled putting together the final document and sending it off for printing.</p>
