brief: To design and build a website for a cuisine of our own choosing. The website was to act as an ambassador for our chosen cuisine
execution: <p>I chose to design a website that did not contain stereotypical Italian elements as I felt that this can often lead to ‘cheesy’ designs. I believe that even so, this website was still recognisable as an Italian themed website.<br>I believe that the result was a clean and simple web layout that communicated its content well.</p><p>View the website at <a href="http://samjdavis.com/italiano">samjdavis.com/italiano</a></p>
