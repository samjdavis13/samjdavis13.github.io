brief: During an Internship at <a href="http://weareforge.co/" target="_blank">Forge Creative</a> I was tasked with creating a visual identity and website for the fictitious company, Yugen Hotels and Suites. 
execution: My execution included a geometric based logo that played with the 'y' from Yugen's name. Along with a logo, I developed a brand usage style guide along with a functioning website prototype which can be viewed at <a href="http://sjd.co/yugen-hotels/">sjd.co/yugen-hotels</a>.
