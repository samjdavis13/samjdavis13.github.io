brief: To design a poster that teaches the user how to do something.
execution: I chose to make my poster based off the instructional found at&#58; <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Lego-Thumb-Drive/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Lego-Thumb-Drive/</a><br><br>I wanted my design tp have a utilitarian look and feel to it as I thought this would be the most clear to understand. I wanted the poster to be as functional as possible without being distracting. It was for this reason that I kept things extremely minimal.<br>What resulted was a succesful instructional that I was able to get a family member to follow and succcesfully create the product.
